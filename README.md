Term paper
----------

Pick an original article from this list that is **related to bioinformatics data
analysis.** Focus more on articles that use high-throughput data in their
research, either genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, or other
big data related to biological questions and experiments. Stay away from papers
that focus mainly on classical epidemiology, conventional risk factors, or
biostatistics, that do not have much utilization of biological data.

scientific knowledge on this topic. Emphasize on **“why”** this study needed to
be done.

**Section 2: What this study adds**

In one or two single sentence bullet points, give a simple answer to the
questions **“What do we now know as a result of this study that we did not know
before?”** “**Is there any implications for practice, research, policy, or
public health?”**

Be brief, succinct, specific, and accurate.

**Section 3: How the data were analyzed**

Pick 3 figures and describe the followings

1.  What is question that this figure tried to answer?

2.  What data have been generated to answer the question?

3.  What analysis have been done to get to the conclusion?
